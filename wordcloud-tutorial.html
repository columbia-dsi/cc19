<p>Chengyou Ju and Yujie Wang</p>
<p>This Rmd file is created by Chengyou Ju (UNI: cj2624) and Yujie Wang (UNI: yw3442) for STAT GR5702 Community Contribution Group 15.</p>
<p>In this file, we will provide a tutorial on how to draw Wordcloud graphs using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package in R.</p>
<p>The dataset in this project are from the <strong>demoFreq</strong> package.</p>
<p>This is the GitHub repo for our project: <a href="https://github.com/ju-chengyou/5702_Community_Contribution_15" class="uri">https://github.com/ju-chengyou/5702_Community_Contribution_15</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p>A Wordcloud is a visual representation of text data. Wordclouds are useful for quickly perceiving the most prominent terms, which makes them widely used in media and well understood by the public.</p>
<p>A Wordcloud is a collection of words depicted in different sizes. The bigger and bolder the word appears, the greater frequency within a given text and the more important it is.</p>
<p>There are two packages in R that can help us draw a wordcloud. <code>wordcloud</code> is the basic package to build the graph, while <code>wordcloud2</code> package allows more customization. In our demo, we will focus on the <code>wordcloud2</code> package, which is more widely used.</p>
</div>
<div id="demo-of-wordcloud2-package" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> 2. Demo of <code>wordcloud2</code> Package</h2>
<p>For our demo, we will use a built-in dataset <code>demoFreq</code>, which has 1011 observations of 2 variables, words and frequancy.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters for wordcloud2</strong> from Rdocumentation<br>
<code>data</code> - data frame with word and freqency of the word<br>
<code>size</code> - Font size, default is 1. The larger size means the bigger word<br>
<code>fontFamily</code> - font used in the word cloud<br>
<code>fontWeight</code> - Font weight to use, e.g. normal, bold or 600<br>
<code>color</code> - color of the text, keyword ’random-dark’ and ’random-light’ can be used.<br>
<code>backgroundColor</code> - Color of the background<br>
<code>minRotation</code> - If the word should rotate, the minimum rotation (in rad) the text should rotate.<br>
<code>maxRotation</code> - If the word should rotate, the maximum rotation (in rad) the text should rotate.<br>
<code>shuffle</code> - Shuffle the points to draw so the result will be different each time for the same list and settings.<br>
<code>rotateRatio</code> - Probability for the word to rotate. Set the number to 1 to always rotate.<br>
<code>shape</code> - The shape of the “cloud” to draw. Can be a keyword present. <br>
<code>widgetsize</code> - size of the widgets<br>
<code>figPath</code> - The path to a figure used as a mask.<br>
<code>hoverFunction</code> - Callback to call when the cursor enters or leaves a region occupied by a word.<br></p>

<p>Building a wordcloud graph is simple. We can use the <code>wordcloud2</code> package directly after successfully installing it.</p>

As we can see, the word cloud is easy to build and to read. Words with large frequency like ‘said’ and ‘oil’ are displayed in big font size.<br> It is actually an interactive plot. If we hover on a certain word, it will pop up the word with its frequency.</p>
